                                                         CodeSync - Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor
CodeSync is a full-stack web application that allows multiple users to write and edit code together in a shared project environment, similar to a simplified version of VS Code Live Share or Google Docs for developers.

 About The Project  =>
In today's remote-first world, developers need better tools to collaborate. Screen sharing is often laggy and non-interactive, while sending code snippets back and forth is inefficient. I built CodeSync to solve this problem directly. It's a web-based platform that provides a shared, real-time environment for pair programming, technical interviews, or educational mentoring, making remote collaboration feel as seamless as being in the same room.

Key Features
‚ö° Real-Time Sync: Powered by WebSockets, code changes are broadcast instantly to all connected users without delay.

üóÇÔ∏è Full Project Structure: Go beyond single files. Organize your work with a complete hierarchical file and folder system.

‚úçÔ∏è Professional Editor: Integrates the Monaco Editor‚Äîthe engine behind VS Code‚Äîfor a familiar, feature-rich coding experience with syntax highlighting.

üíæ Persistent Storage: Projects are saved to a MongoDB database, so you can close your browser and pick up right where you left off.

üîó Sharable Workspaces: Every project gets a unique URL, making it easy to invite collaborators to your session.
